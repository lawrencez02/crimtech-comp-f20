I set y = "My Favorite String"
y.includes("hello") outputted false, since "My Favorite String" does not contain the string "hello. The function .includes checks whether a substring is in a particular string.
y.repeat(10) outputs "My Favorite String" 10 times, all back to back. The function .repeat clearly repeats the string as many times as you specify.

square(2.5) returns 6.25
square("Hello") returns NaN
